# CLAUDE.md — apps/mobile (Flutter)

User-facing app for both clients and taskers. Calls the NestJS API for everything — no business logic in Flutter.

## Mandatory reading before any UI work

**Before designing, implementing, or reviewing any Flutter screen, read [`docs/brand/DESIGN-QUALITY-CHARTER.md`](../../docs/brand/DESIGN-QUALITY-CHARTER.md).** This is not optional. The charter is the quality bar and the rejection filter — every screen this session touches must pass its 12 rejection criteria and the per-screen design gate checklist.

The mandate, in three lines:

> **You are an award-winning Flutter UI designer.**
> **Do not create generic Flutter screens.**
> **Design every screen like a premium production application.**

If a screen you're about to write would blend in with any Material 3 starter template, stop and redesign. The bar is not "shippable" — it is "screenshottable and recognisably JOBBees."

Every screen PR must include the completed **Design gate checklist** (defined in the charter). Every screen must have a Widgetbook composed page (`widgetbook/screens/<category>/<name>_page.dart`) built *before* the `lib/features/.../screens/*.dart` implementation. This is the "Widgetbook lock" — design contract before wiring.

**Editing an existing Sprint 2 screen?** Check [`docs/brand/design-debt.md`](../../docs/brand/design-debt.md) first. If the file is listed as **Tier A** (retrofit now) or **Tier B** (retrofit at next touch), the design gate applies to your PR and the retrofit must land in the same PR before merge. Update the tracker status when done.

## Hard rules — never violate

1. **Never hardcode colours.** Always use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.x` or named tokens from `core/theme`. Light only at MVP; theme tokens are scaffolded so dark mode is one swap later.
2. **Never call dio directly from screens.** Use a repository class (`features/<name>/repositories/<name>_repository.dart`) that wraps the API call.
3. **Every screen has four states.** Loading, error, empty, content. Use a `AsyncValue`-aware widget pattern.
4. **Riverpod for ALL state.** No `StatefulWidget` for app-level state. Local `useState` (via flutter_hooks) only for screen-local UI state (toggle, text controller).
5. **Auth state changes drive navigation.** Subscribe to `authStateProvider` in the router redirect; never push routes from a button on a login screen.
6. **Stripe payments via official Stripe Flutter SDK.** Never roll custom card input. Apple Pay / Google Pay through Stripe's PaymentSheet.
7. **Soft delete is server-side.** Never call delete endpoints expecting hard delete on user-facing entities.
8. **Network errors render as the error state.** Never silently swallow. Use the `ErrorMapper` to convert dio errors to user messages.
9. **Always set `autofillHints: [AutofillHints.oneTimeCode]`** on OTP fields. iOS Smart Auth + Android SMS Retriever depend on it.
10. **App lifecycle handlers** for background tasks (location during active job). Pause on `AppLifecycleState.paused`, resume on `resumed`.


## Conventions

- **Naming:** `snake_case` for files, `PascalCase` for classes, `camelCase` for variables.
- **Imports:** package imports above relative imports, alphabetised.
- **Models:** generated via `freezed` + `json_serializable`. Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after model edits.
- **Riverpod:** use `@riverpod` code-gen syntax, not the legacy provider syntax. Run build_runner after provider edits.
- **Strings:** all user-facing strings in `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` (even though we're English-only at MVP — scaffolds i18n cheaply).
- **Form validation:** use `reactive_forms` package or manual `TextEditingController` + validator functions in providers.

## Theme + brand (locked from RN prototype + Material 3)

**Brand colors and theme are locked** in `apps/mobile/lib/theme/`:

- `colors.dart` — JOBBees palette + light + dark `ColorScheme` (M3-native) + gradient constants
- `app_theme.dart` — full `ThemeData` (Material 3, Inter font via `google_fonts`, generous corners, spacing/shape/motion tokens)

**Source of truth (do not invent new tokens):**

- Primary: `#ED713E` (honey orange, logo-true) with 9 shades
- Dark: `#1A1A2E` (deep navy-charcoal) with 9 shades
- Semantic: `success #22C55E`, `warning #F59E0B`, `error #EF4444`, `info #3B82F6`
- Font: Inter (Regular/Medium/SemiBold/Bold via `google_fonts`)
- Border radius scale: 12 / 16 / 24 / 32

**Companion docs:**

- `docs/brand/COLORS.md` — full palette + usage rules + contrast table
- `docs/brand/UI-PRINCIPLES.md` — Material 3, typography, motion, haptics, accessibility, dark mode strategy

**Don't ship dark mode at MVP** but the dark tokens are defined. Adding dark mode later = flip `themeMode: ThemeMode.system` in `main.dart`. No widget rewrites needed.

**Rules:**

- All widgets use `Theme.of(context).colorScheme.X` — never raw `Color(0xFF...)`
- Never introduce a new brand color without updating `docs/brand/COLORS.md` + `colors.dart` + the Tailwind tokens in `apps/admin` + `apps/web` together
- Use the M3 type scale (`Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium` etc.), not raw `TextStyle`s
- Use the spacing tokens (`JobbeesSpacing.lg`) for layout — no magic numbers
- Respect reduced motion: check `MediaQuery.of(context).disableAnimations` before non-essential animations
- Haptic feedback on key moments (`HapticFeedback.lightImpact()` on offer placed, `heavyImpact()` on job completed)

## Testing

- Widget tests for screens: `test/features/<name>/<screen>_test.dart`
- Use `riverpod_test` for provider unit tests
- Mock API responses via dio's `MockAdapter`
- Run with `flutter test`
- Integration tests in `integration_test/` (separate from widget tests)

## Run

- `cd apps/mobile`
- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter run` (with a device or emulator connected)
- `flutter test` (unit + widget tests)
- `flutter analyze` (static analysis, fail on warnings)

## What's NOT here

- Apple Developer + Google Play accounts (client-owned)
- App icons, splash assets (client-supplied)
- Branding (client-supplied)
- Backend code (lives in `apps/api`)
